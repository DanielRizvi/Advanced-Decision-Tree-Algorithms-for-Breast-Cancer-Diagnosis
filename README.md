Ensemble Learning Techniques for Breast Cancer Classification: A Comparative Study of Bagging, Random Forest, and Boosting using CSV Dataset

This project aims to investigate the effectiveness of advanced decision tree algorithms, specifically Bagging, Random Forest, and Boosting, for breast cancer diagnosis. The project utilizes a breast cancer dataset in CSV format to train and test the decision tree models. The project is implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library. The decision tree models are trained on a training dataset and then evaluated on a test dataset. The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy & precision. A comparative analysis of the models is conducted to determine the most effective algorithm for breast cancer diagnosis.

The project provides a detailed analysis of each algorithm's performance and offers insights into the features that are most significant in diagnosing breast cancer. The project is available on GitHub and includes the Python code, the breast cancer dataset in CSV format, and a detailed README file explaining the project's implementation and results. The project's code and results can be easily replicated and extended to other medical diagnosis applications.
