Ensemble Learning Techniques for Breast Cancer Classification: A Comparative Study of Bagging, Random Forest, and Boosting using CSV Dataset

Breast cancer is a significant public health concern, and early detection is critical to improving patient outcomes. Decision tree algorithms are frequently used for medical diagnosis tasks, including breast cancer diagnosis. This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced decision tree algorithms, specifically Bagging, Random Forest, and Boosting, for breast cancer diagnosis.

This project aims to investigate the effectiveness of advanced decision tree algorithms, specifically Bagging, Random Forest, and Boosting, for breast cancer diagnosis. The project utilizes a breast cancer dataset in CSV format to train and test the decision tree models. The project is implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library. The decision tree models are trained on a training dataset and then evaluated on a test dataset. The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy & precision. A comparative analysis of the models is conducted to determine the most effective algorithm for breast cancer diagnosis.

The project provides a detailed analysis of each algorithm's performance and offers insights into the features that are most significant in diagnosing breast cancer. 

The project's code, dataset, and results are available on GitHub, making it easy to replicate and extend the project to other medical diagnosis applications. The repository file provides detailed information on the project's implementation. The project's code is well-documented, making it easy to understand the decision tree modeling process and modify the code to fit different datasets.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of advanced decision tree algorithms for breast cancer diagnosis, offering insights into the features that are most significant in diagnosing breast cancer and the most effective algorithm for the task.
